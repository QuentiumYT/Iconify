    Is it Safe?
  </summary>

<br>

If you're concerned about the safety of using Iconify, you'll be pleased to know that the extension is 100% safe and secure to use. The extension does not track any of your browser data or any other personal information, so you can browse and download premium SVG icons with complete peace of mind.


The way Iconify works is by replacing your non-premium account token with a premium token from the server when you click on the SVG button. This token is then used to send a request to the respective icon server, which returns the icon as if you were a premium user. The extension then parses the icon and creates a downloadable icon in SVG format.

Aside from this process, the extension does not do anything else that might raise security concerns. You can use Iconify knowing that your data and personal information are completely safe.

In conclusion, Iconify is a safe and secure extension that provides premium SVG icons for your design projects. With its user-friendly interface and seamless integration with Flaticon's server, you can browse, search, and download premium icons with ease and confidence.
